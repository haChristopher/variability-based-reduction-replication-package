## Files

The experiments include the following files:

- **CPU Utilization**: csv file downloaded from google cloud containing the instance cpu utilization (from the measurement run)
- **Sqlite .db file**: sqlite database file containing the measurement results 
- **Call Graphs**: there are 1-3 instance folders containing the .out files generated by the profiler. Some folders might already contain converted dot files.


The cpu csv contains data for four instances. "backup-mt-1" is the orchastrator while all others with ending ".*-instance-x" are the actual measurement instances:
